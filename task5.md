# Task 5 Question

1. The additional module that i will need to import into the program is the datetime
2. 
3. date.strftime(%day/%month/%Year)

## Additional Task - Variable roles

1. Fixed Variable - a variable that programs without any calculation and the variable wont be changed
   Stepper - A variable which keeps count of the number being repeated in the program
   Most Recent Holder - a Variable used to record the last thing that is being inputed by the user or the latest value from an array
   Most Wanted Holder - A variable that keeps track of the lowest or highest values in the inputs
   Gatherer - A variable that accumalates or tallies up set of data and inputs, its used for calculating totals
   Transformation - used to store the result of a calculation involving more than one variable
   Follower - used to keep check of a previous value of a variable so the new value is compared
   Temporary - used for storing something for a very short period of time

2. Fixed Variable - this is used to remember the number of array elements in use
   Stepper - During iterations, a variable is used to keep a count of number of repetitions
   Most Recent Holder - Storing the latest of a series of values input by the user to add to a running total
   Most Wanted Holder - when searching through a set  of values for the largest value, the largest value is stored
   Gatherer - Calculating the total of a series of values, keep a running total of all the values
   Transformations - Storing the result of a conversion of a measurement in inches to a measurement in metres
   Follower - Before updating a variable its current value is copied to the follower
   Temporary - used as the intermediate storage when swapping values in variables
   
## Additional Task - Functions and Parameters

1. pass by value creates a copy of the original variable and when changes are made it will have no effect on the original variable and it is lost when the program execution returns to the code,
and pass by reference is when the variable inside the routine uses a reference to the same memory location as the variable passed and any changes to the contents of the variable are accessible to the program code
